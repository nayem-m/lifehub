# LifeHub
LifeHub, an app to organize your life Life areas managing app inspired by the PARA method. \
Based on a relational database that links all areas of life.
I made this project for my first year programming class. 

In our lives there are many different areas or life buckets. 
Those areas can be family, school work, GYM, etc..
Each area has projects under it that gets you closer to the goal that you want to achieve in a certain area.
And each project has tasks under it that gets you closer to completing a project.
With this view on one's personal life, organizing what you do every day gets easier.
